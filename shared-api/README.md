Implementation must preserve the `/api/all` response shape, dexonline-link safety contract, and literal `" / "` verse delimiter. This repository contains module source, tests, fixtures, and declared configuration names only. Production secrets, provider IDs, source locks, and deployments remain in the private `shared-api-host` control plane.

A public merge does not deploy. Production adoption requires an explicit, reviewed source-lock update in `shared-api-host`.
